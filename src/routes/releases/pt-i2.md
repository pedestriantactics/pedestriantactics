The original posted designed for stress testing our print partners. Features line size and color bleed tests, along with a grid of swatches indexed by RGB values.

This poster is made from 170g paper sourced from Sappi in Japan. An average tree can be made into approximately 762 of these. A 0.3USD charge is included in the cost which is sent to Terrapass as an attempt to offset the environmental impact of this product.

I like trees.
