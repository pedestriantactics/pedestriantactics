As requested in the comments, this is a copy of the poster that I designed to stress test my printing partner in preparation for printing future posters. The poster features line size and color bleed tests, along with a grid of swatches indexed by RGB values. The typography is set in two versions of an [upcoming typeface](../hyperwalk) I'm working on.

MSRP: 21USD

This poster is made from 170g paper sourced from Sappi in Japan. An average tree can be made into approximately 762 of these. A 0.3USD charge is included in the cost which is sent to Terrapass as an attempt to offset the environmental impact of this product.

I like trees.
