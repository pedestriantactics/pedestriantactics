Based on a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s7vxIrigRo) I made awhile back, this poster breaks down a typical electronic snare drum into three sonic components, with details on timing, frequency, and real world examples that can be used.

MSRP: 26USD

This poster is made from 170g paper sourced from Sappi in Japan. An average tree can be made into approximately 762 of these. A 0.3USD charge is included in the cost which is sent to Terrapass as an attempt to offset the environmental impact of this product.

I like trees.
