## A breakdown of a typical electronic snare drum into three sonic components, with details on timing, frequency, and real world examples

<!-- <div class="warning environment">

This poster is made from 170g paper sourced from Sappi in Japan. An average tree can be made into approximately 762 of these. A 0.3USD charge is included in the cost which is sent to Terrapass as an attempt to offset the environmental impact of this product.

I like trees.
